    <h2>French toast is a dish made of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs, sugar and typically milk, then pan fried.</h2>
    <p>There are many, fancy variations on this basic recipe. This easy recipe works with many types of bread – white, whole wheat, brioche, cinnamon-raisin, Italian, or French. Serve hot with butter or margarine and maple syrup.</p>
    <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>Half a cup of Milk</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon vanilla </li>
        <li>Two tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons maple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice bread crosswise so that each slice is about 1-inch thick. Cut larger slices into halves or thirds, if desired. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip slices (do not soak) in egg mixture and cook until golden brown on both sides.</li>
        <li>Keep egg mixture stirred and spices well blended.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve with warm maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs stirred, whipped or beaten together while being gently heated, typically with salt, butter, oil and sometimes other ingredients.</h2>
    <p>Cooking isn't about always doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example.</p>
    <p> Adding juicy, sweet cherry tomatoes to a scramble tastes great, but it's not a common practice since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form.  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Pinch large pepper flakes</li>
        <li>9 Cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons thinly sliced basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Pinch sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs and red pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir tomatoes, feta, and basil leaves into egg mixture.</li>
